# Insurance Data Analysis

## Problem Statement
ABC Insurance, an insurance agency, possesses a large dataset containing information about their policyholders and claims. They aim to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this dataset to uncover insights that can drive better business decisions and enhance operations.

The focus is to analyze the impact of various factors like body types and environments on the insurance premium. Notably, the cost implication of diseases or treatments can vary significantly under different conditions. For instance, the premium for smokers might be higher than for non-smokers due to an increased risk of chronic diseases. Through this analysis, the agency seeks to delve into healthcare premium costs.

## Description:
An insurance agency, ABC Insurance, has a large dataset containing information about their policyholders and claims. They want to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this dataset to gain insights that can help them make better business decisions and improve their operations.

The agency wants to analyze the different body types and the environment that affect the premium. The disease's effect or the cost of treatment differs depending on the circumstances. For example, a smoker's medical insurance premium may be higher than that of a healthy person, because smokers are more likely to develop chronic diseases. The agency wants to analyze the data to research healthcare premium costs.
## Objective
The goal is to analyze the dataset to develop a model capable of predicting medical insurance costs based on various input features.

## Domain
Healthcare

## Dataset
**Name**: Insurance dataset (`insurance.csv`)

**Description**:

| Column    | Description                                              |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `age`     | Age of the person                                        |
| `sex`     | Female or Male                                           |
| `BMI`     | BMI value to estimate an individual's health condition   |
| `children`| Number of children (1,2,3,4, or 5)                        |
| `smoker`  | Indicates if the person is a smoker                      |
| `region`  | Specifies the region (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest) |
| `charges` | The amount of insurance premium                          |

## Steps to Be Followed
1. **Import Libraries and Load Data**:
   - Import necessary libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, and Seaborn.
   - Load the `insurance.csv` dataset.

2. **Data Inspection**:
   - Check the shape of the dataset and the data types of each column.

3. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Inspect the dataset for missing values.
   - Determine and apply appropriate measures to handle these missing values.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explore the relationship between features and the target column (charges).
   - Use count plots for categorical columns and scatter plots for numerical columns to visualize these relationships.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   - Perform data visualization by plotting feature vs. feature to understand their interactions.

6. **Analysis of Premium Charges**:
   - Investigate how the premium charges for smokers and non-smokers vary with age.

7. **Observations**:
   - After each step, document your observations and findings.

This analysis will enable ABC Insurance to derive actionable insights on insurance premium determinants and facilitate the creation of a predictive model for medical insurance costs.
